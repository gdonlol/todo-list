# TodoList
Basic task management application created using the MERN stack

## Features
- Add/delete items in lists
- Add/delete lists
- Edit list name/desc
- Account authentication system

## Usage:
1. **Clone repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories in your terminal or command prompt, then run `npm install` to install the required dependencies for each part of the application.
3. **Create environment file**: In the backend directory, create a file named `.env`. This file will store sensitive information such as database connection URLs and secret keys.
4. **Configure MongoDB URL**: Inside the `.env` file, set up a MongoDB connection URL using the format `MONGOURL='<URL HERE>'`. Replace `<URL HERE>` with the actual URL of your MongoDB database cluster.
5. **Set secret key**: Also in the `.env` file, define a secret key for use in account token authentication. Use the format `SECRET='<any string>'`, replacing `<any string>` with a string of your choice.
6. **Start the application**: Once you've configured the environment variables, you can start the application by running `npm start` in the root directory of the project. This command will launch both the frontend and backend servers, allowing you to access the application in your web browser.

My first solo fullstack MERN app :)
Very bare-bones features and it could definitely do better security wise. Maybe I'll update it in the future but I have so many other project ideas that are a lot more interesting than the good old todo list ðŸ˜‚

Updates:
02/23/2024:
- Added token authentication for security
- Added limits for lists (max 10/user) and items in lists (max 50/list, each max 100 chars)
- Fixed bug where deleting a list does not clear it's items from database
